# Learning Algorithms and Data Structures

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I'm learning how to code by studying algorithms and data structures!

## Introduction

This repository serves as my personal learning space where I explore various algorithms and data structures commonly used in computer science. Through this journey, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills, improve my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts, and ultimately become a better programmer.

## Contents

In this repository, you will find:

- Implementation of popular algorithms such as:
  - Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort)
  - Searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
  - Graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
- Implementation of fundamental data structures such as:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (e.g., Binary Search Tree)
  - Graphs

Each algorithm and data structure is implemented in a separate file or directory, along with explanatory comments and examples to aid understanding.

## Contribution

While this repository primarily serves as my personal learning space, contributions are welcome! If you notice any bugs, improvements, or want to add your own implementations of algorithms or data structures, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
